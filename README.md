# Capstone-Project-5
This is my Capstone project 5.
It is intended to serve as an online library database where you can store/add/remove reviews and ratings of books and information about them.
Steps to set up.
1. Open up your terminal, I would recommend VSCode. Then copy and paste the following command lines
2. git clone https://github.com/Darky321/Capstone-Project-5.git
3. cd Capstone\ Project\ 5/
4. npm i

Your code is now set up. Now steps to run it on your computer. 
1. Type "node index.js" to run the code. The code is now running on port 3000 of your computer.
2. At anytime to stop running the code go to terminal and do "Ctrl + C"
3. Go to your browser, I use Google Chrome. Open a new tab and type in "localhost:3000".
Now you have full access to the website.
